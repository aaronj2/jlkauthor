<h2><span>Why</span> Our Books?</h2>
<h2>ONE STEP AT A TIME</h2>
<p><strong>Carrie Lane Gruselle</strong>, well-known  composer, arranger,
and pedagogue.</p><br />
<p><em>&quot;Jennie Lou Klim's ONE STEP AT A TIME series, is the culmination of years of expert teaching, carefully considered pedagogical principals and attention to children and their needs.</em></p><br />
<p><em>These five books address each component of the learning process clearly and progressively, simply and effectively, in terms of both technique and musicianship. It is equally suited to serve as a supplemental note-reading book for the Suzuki student, or as a stand-alone traditional method book.</em></p><br />
<p><em>It is gratifying to see such systematic and thorough books filled with well chosen repertoire, from time-honored compositions and folk-tunes to creative original material, each example carefully chosen to fulfill a purpose. These books are an excellent resource for teachers of aspiring musicians.&quot;</em></p><br />

<p><strong>Haroutune Bedelian</strong>, master teacher and violin virtuoso, currently Associate Professor of Music at the University of California in Irvine, California, and former Professor of Violin at the Royal Academy of Music in London, England.</p><br />
<p><em>&quot;It is a distinct privilege for me to write a preface to &quot;ONE STEP AT A TIME&quot;, a set of five outstanding method books for the violin by Jennie Lou Klim. These important books not only cover very clearly and logically all the fundamental steps necessary, but they also combine the concepts of perceiving music with the development of the young musician.</em></p><br />
<p><em>Having known Jennie Lou Klim now for many years as a devoted teacher and violinist, with the care and natural instinct of educating and nurturing a child's interest in music, we have here an extraordinary result of bringing many years of knowledge into a logical and organized series of five books that cover all areas that are necessary for the talented child.</em></p><br />
<p><em>The presentation is logically organized step by step, introducing the student to a positive and functional method where the progress is a natural growth. The young beginner is introduced to the simplest and most direct approach to learning to play the instrument. Finger patterns are combined with an explanation of harmony and keys, introduced at the right moment. This, in combination with the grasp of the fundamentals, this is an invaluable approach to the understanding of the complexities of harmonic, melodic and rhythmic language on which our musical culture is based on. This allows the imagination to freely explore itself through the medium of sound and the instruments.&quot;</em></p><br />

<p><strong>Julia McKenzie</strong>, violinist, performs with many Boston ensembles including Boston Baroque, Handel &amp; Haydn Society Orchestra, Boston Cecilia, Cantata Singers and the Boston Modern Orchestra Project. Ms. McKenzie is an alumna of the New England Conservatory of Music and holds a M.F.A. degree from the University of California, Irvine. She is currently on the faculty of the Wellesley Public Schools Performing Arts Department and has recorded for Meridian and Telarc records.</p><br />
<p><em>&quot;I really like these ONE STEP AT A TIME books. The author, Jennie Lou Klim, thinks just like an experienced beginning violin teacher, knowing to keep it simple, and do a little at a time. I would definitely have my kids use these books next year, and will recommend them to other teachers. The books will be useful for students in Suzuki Books 1 -3.</em></p><br />
<p><em>The method of teaching sharps and flats through finger patterns is easy to understand, and the small finger charts on many of the pages is helpful. It is good that she hasn't placed fingerings over the notes, and that there is a lot of room for teachers to add their own markings. Rhythm is also taught in a smart and fun way. I love these books!&quot;</em></p><br />

<p><strong>Amy Harris Jevitt</strong>, graduate in violin performance at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, former concertmaster of the Brevard Symphony Orchestra; principal second violin in the Orlando Philharmonic; and currently adjunct professor of violin and viola at Brevard Community College, Melbourne, FL; associate concertmaster of the BSO, and teacher in her private studio.</p><br />
<p><em>&quot;I am happy to recommend the fantastic books called ONE STEP AT A TIME for the beginning student, young and old. Finally, someone has developed a method that shows the student a logical progression through the keys and the different finger patterns. These books are clear and easy to understand, without the frustration of too much all at once. Mrs. Klim has truly found the key to teaching the violin in this wonderful series. I would highly recommend it to all teachers and parents of violin students.&quot;</em></p><br />

<h2>EASY AS DO-RE-MI</h2>
<p><strong>Natalie Hoang</strong>, B.S. in Music Education from Malone College, Canton, OH; member of Space Coast Symphony; Itinerant strings teacher in Brevard County, FL.</p><br />
<p><em>&quot;I highly recommend using the EASY AS DO-RE-MI series in the classroom.  I have been using Mrs. Klim's books for four years in my elementary, middle, and high school orchestra classes.  It has taken my orchestras to new levels of playing, and my programs have been growing every year.  Mrs. Klim is an accomplished violin teacher who has a wealth of knowledge in teaching strings, and has dedicated her life to constantly perfecting her teaching and her books.  I really love the fact that each page only has one concept, so that the children are not bombarded with too much information.  I have seen amazing progress and astonishing results in my classes from using her method books. I would recommend them for all ages as a wonderful tool for learning a stringed instrument.&quot;</em></p><br />

<p><strong>Timothy Ashe</strong>, B.S., M. Ed from University of Bridgeport,CT; Orchestra director and  itinerant strings teacher in Brevard County, FL.</p><br />
<p><em>&quot;I have been teaching music for six years, and feel the EASY AS DO-RE-MI books have been a major asset to my music program.  With all the classroom method books on the market today, Mrs. Klim's books have impressed me the most. Her style is both intuitive and engaging, enabling students to read music in a sequential yet practical approach.  Her concepts are simple to comprehend, which in turn, propels the student to progress faster with a higher level of comprehension.  Because of the EASY AS DO-RE-MI series, my students now read music more fluently.  Every classroom should own a set all three books!&quot;</em></p><br />
