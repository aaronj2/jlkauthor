<p><strong>Excerpt</strong><br />
Jennie Lou Klim began string programs in public school systems, started summer string
			camps, and conducted workshops with beginning as well as established strings teachers in both Pennsylvania
			and in Florida. In 1985, she co-founded the Somerset Music Festival and Summer School with Kypros Markou,
			serving as its Executive Director and teacher for five years. This initiative received national recognition
			because of its excellent program and faculty of internationally known master teachers and soloists.
			As a performer, she served as concertmaster and soloist with the International Cathedral Music Festival
			in Salisbury, Coventry, and London, England. Her former students play professionally as members of symphony
			orchestras, teaching privately and in the public school systems. She continues an active schedule of teaching,
			playing, and serving as a consultant or clinician.</p></div></div>
